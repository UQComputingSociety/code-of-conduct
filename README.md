# Code of Conduct

UQCS is dedicated to providing a community for everyone. Community participants violating the following rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the executive committee.

We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* offensive comments related to:
  * gender (including identity, history or expression)
  * sexual orientation
  * disability
  * physical appearance
  * race
  * religion
  * programming experience or background
* sexual images and languages in public spaces
* deliberate intimidation
* stalking
* harassing photography or recording
* sustained disruption of community activities, spaces, or other events
* unwelcome physical contact
* unwelcome sexual attention
* calls for violence against members
* inciting members to violence or self-harm

All participants in the community and community-associated activities are subject to the anti-harassment policy.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the executive committee may take any action they deem appropriate, including:
* warning the offender
* temporary expulsion of the member from the community
* permanent expulsion of the member from the community
* referral of the offender to university authorities or law enforcement (where appropriate)

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the executive committee immediately.

Unsolicited advertising is also prohibited on UQCS-managed platforms unless the express permission of the UQCS committee has been provided (as with the blanket permission extended to the #jobs-bulletin Discord channel). Such posts will be immediately removed and repeat offenders will be subject to the disciplinary procedures outlined above at the discretion of the committee. Note that sharing of personal projects is not considered advertising and is explicitly encouraged (on appropriate platforms), except in the case where those projects are of a commercial nature and are being shared with the intent to acquire customers.

All participants in the community and community-associated activities are expected to abide by the University of Queensland [Student Integrity and Misconduct Policy](http://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.60.04-student-integrity-and-misconduct).

We expect participants to follow these rules at all UQCS-supported venues (including online). These venues include, but are not necessarily limited to:
* All digital platforms branded with or managed by UQCS (Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Github, YouTube etc.)
* All events organized or co-organised by UQCS

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact a member of the executive committee through any of the channels listed on the [UQCS contact page](https://uqcs.org.au/contact).

This CoC was adapted from the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](https://typelevel.org/conduct).
